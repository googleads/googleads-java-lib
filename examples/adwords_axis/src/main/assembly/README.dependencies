This directory contains all of the dependencies that Maven will pull down when
using the AdWords API with Apache Axis example project.

Note that using these JARs is *not* the recommended approach - we recommend
using Maven. Using these JARs will force you to manually update your project
every time our library adds or upgrades dependencies.
