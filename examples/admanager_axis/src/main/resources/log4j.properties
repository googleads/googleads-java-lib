# The Google Ads API Java Client Library uses the slf4j logging facade, allowing
# you to plug in a logging framework of your choice. This configuration file
# sets up the logging infrastructure using log4j. If you wish to take advantage
# of this file and use log4j as your framework, you must include both the log4j
# artifact and the artifact to bridge slf4j with log4j. Please see
# http://www.slf4j.org for more information about slf4j.
#
# See the Google Ads API Java Client Library Logging page for more details:
# https://github.com/googleads/googleads-java-lib/wiki/Logging
#
# This configuration simply logs messages to stderr. For more advanced
# options including logging to files, see the log4j.tofiles.properties
# file in this directory.

# Point each log to its appender. The first word after the equals sign
# represents the level of logging for each log.
