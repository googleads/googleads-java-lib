/**
 * 
 *       Use the {@code MutateJobService} to schedule large batches of updates to
 *       your AdWords campaigns as asynchronous mutate jobs, and to retrieve the
 *       status, results or statistics of your recent jobs.
 *       
 *       <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> {@code MutateJobService} is being replaced by
 *       {@code BatchJobService}. New development should use {@code BatchJobService};
 *       existing code should start moving to it.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>Use this service when you wish to release your application from actively
 *       waiting on a synchronous response. Your application can do other things or
 *       even shutdown while we execute mutations asynchronously.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>Requests to the service will fail if the request was invalid or if any of
 *       a job's structural constraints are violated, and depending on the operation,
 *       the job will not get created or updated.</p>
 *       <p>
 *       Once a job has been submitted, you may check its status periodically, by
 *       calling {@link #get}.</p>
 *       <p class="caution"><b>Caution:</b>
 *       Do not poll the job status too frequently or you will risk getting your
 *       customer rate-limited.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>Once a job's status changes to {@code COMPLETED}, you can retrieve the
 *       job's results.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>A job can fail even after it has been accepted for processing. For
 *       example, a job may fail if the system experienced too many transient errors.
 *       In this scenario, the job will get a status of {@code FAILED} and will
 *       stop processing.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>The submitted operations are processed in batches for efficiency. Each
 *       batch is processed atomically so that either all of them have successful
 *       results, or they all fail with a failure result for the entire batch.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>Normally, jobs could be processed in parallel. This may cause concurrent
 *       mutations to the same entities to fail, though these would be retried later,
 *       see below. If you want to serialize the processing of jobs, you could
 *       specify prerequisites through the optional {@link JobPolicy}.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>You may choose to avoid submitting a new job for mutating an entity while
 *       another job for the same entity has not completed yet.</p>
 *       
 *       <p>The service will keep retrying operations when transient failures occur.
 *       However, if these failures persist for several hours or more serious ones
 *       occur, the service will abort a job leaving some or all of its operations
 *       unprocessed.</p>
 *
