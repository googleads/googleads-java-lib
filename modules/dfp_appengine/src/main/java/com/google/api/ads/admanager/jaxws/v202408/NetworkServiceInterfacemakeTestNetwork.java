/**
 * 
 *             Creates a new blank network for testing purposes using the current login.
 *             
 *             <p>Each login(i.e. email address) can only have one test network. Data from any of your
 *             existing networks will not be transferred to the new test network. Once the test network is
 *             created, the test network can be used in the API by supplying the {@link Network#networkCode}
 *             in the SOAP header or by logging into the Ad Manager UI.
 *             
 *             <p>Test networks are limited in the following ways:
 *             
 *             <ul>
 *             <li>Test networks cannot serve ads.
 *             <li>Because test networks cannot serve ads, reports will always come back without data.
 *             <li>Since forecasting requires serving history, forecast service results will be faked. See
 *             {@link ForecastService} for more info.
 *             <li>Test networks are, by default, Ad Manager networks and don't have any features from Ad
 *             Manager 360. To have additional features turned on, please contact your account manager.
 *             <li>Test networks are limited to 10,000 objects per entity type.
 *             </ul>
 *
