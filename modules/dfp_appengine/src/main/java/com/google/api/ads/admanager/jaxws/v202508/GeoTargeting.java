/**
 * 
 *             Provides line items the ability to target geographical locations. By default, line items target
 *             all countries and their subdivisions. With geographical targeting, you can target line items to
 *             specific countries, regions, metro areas, and cities. You can also exclude the same.
 *             
 *             <p>The following rules apply for geographical targeting:
 *             
 *             <ul>
 *             <li>You cannot target and exclude the same location.
 *             <li>You cannot target a child whose parent has been excluded. For example, if the state of
 *             Illinois has been excluded, then you cannot target Chicago.
 *             <li>You must not target a location if you are also targeting its parent. For example, if you
 *             are targeting New York City, you must not have the state of New York as one of the targeted
 *             locations.
 *             <li>You cannot explicitly define inclusions or exclusions that are already implicit. For
 *             example, if you explicitly include California, you implicitly exclude all other states. You
 *             therefore cannot explicitly exclude Florida, because it is already implicitly excluded.
 *             Conversely if you explicitly exclude Florida, you cannot explicitly include California.
 *             </ul>
 *           
 * 
 * <p>Java class for GeoTargeting complex type.
